Python program to fetch the city names of any country in the corpus.

I had countries and cities data in the attached JSON file. Using Pandas module I was reading the data into series type with read_json method of pandas module.

Data had been taken as series instead of Data Frame as number of cities in all the countries is not same.

I had created a Recursive function to go through all the words in the Corpus to fetch the matching words with JSON Library.

Program had been enclosed with timers to print the executed time.
